# FixMPTS Asterix Library
The FixMPTs Asterix Library is a spin off from the [FixMPTS](https://www.fixmpts.org) project. It encapsulates the de- and encoding part for the Asterix protocol.

The Asetrix protocol, maintained by [Eurocontrol](https://www.eurocontrol.int/asterix), is one of the most common protocols used between the different air traffic entities within Europe.
For each purpose a dedicated so called Asterix Category exist. The aim of this library is to support the decoding and encoding of all categories actively used. 

Below please find a table listing the current capabilities per Asterix Category.
